Explanation:

The main entity is the Gymnasium, which has attributes such as id, name, address, and phone_number.
Each Gymnasium can have multiple Sessions, which are characterized by their id, type (sport), schedule, maximum capacity, and the gymnasium_id they belong to.
Each Session can have up to two Coaches, who have attributes like id, last_name, first_name, age, and specialty.
Members are associated with a specific Gymnasium and Session. They have attributes like id, last_name, first_name, address, date_of_birth, gender, gymnasium_id, and session_id.
This ER model represents the relationships between the Gymnasium, Session, Coach, and Member entities. It provides a basic structure for managing members, sessions, and coaches within the gymnasium chain.
